# House_Price_Prediction

## Problem Statement:
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Business Goal:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties for the US-based company. As well as we need to decide which variables are more important in predicting the price of a house.

## Data Analysis
- Uni-variate Analysis- numeric & categorical variables
- Bi-variate Analysis
- Observations from analysis

## Model Building
- Data Preparation 
- Building Linear regression model 
- Building Ridge regression model 
- Building Lasso regression model
- Residual Analysis
- Model Evaluation

## Conclusions
- Linear regression model without regularization ends up with heavy overfitting. Ridge & Lasso regression is very helpful to reduce overfitting. Here, Lasso model is more preferable as we have high dimensional data, it is more interpretable compared to ridge due to feature selection.
